## Critical Issue Found & Fixed

### üö® Issue: Wholesale Prices and Supplier Information Exposed to Agents

**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Agents could view wholesale prices and supplier information directly from database  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

#### What Was Exposed:
1. **esim_plans table** (Direct access by agents):
   - `wholesale_price` - Your cost price
   - `supplier_name` - Provider identity (default: 'esim_access')
   - `supplier_plan_id` - Internal supplier identifiers

2. **orders table** (Direct access by agents):
   - `wholesale_price` - Your cost per order
   - `supplier_order_id` - Supplier transaction IDs

#### How It Was Fixed:

1. **Created Secure Views** (Security Invoker):
   - `agent_safe_plans` - Only exposes retail-relevant fields
   - `agent_safe_orders` - Only exposes customer-facing order data

2. **Restricted RLS Policies**:
   - Agents can NO LONGER query `esim_plans` directly
   - Agents can NO LONGER query `orders` directly  
   - Only admins can access these tables with sensitive data

3. **Fields Hidden from Agents**:
   ```
   esim_plans:
   ‚ùå wholesale_price
   ‚ùå supplier_name  
   ‚ùå supplier_plan_id
   
   orders:
   ‚ùå wholesale_price
   ‚ùå supplier_order_id
   ```

## Current Security Posture

### ‚úÖ What Agents CAN See:
- `agent_safe_plans` view:
  - Plan ID, title, description
  - Country name/code
  - Data amount, validity days
  - Currency, active status
  - Created/updated timestamps

- `agent_safe_orders` view:
  - Their own orders only
  - Retail prices (what they charged customers)
  - Customer information (name, email, phone)
  - eSIM activation codes and QR codes
  - Order status and device compatibility info

### ‚ùå What Agents CANNOT See:
- Wholesale/cost prices
- Supplier names or identifiers
- Supplier order IDs
- Profit margins
- Any other agent's pricing

### ‚úÖ What Only Admins CAN See:
- Full `esim_plans` table with wholesale prices
- Full `orders` table with cost prices
- Complete supplier information
- All agent pricing configurations

---

## Edge Function Security Review

### ‚úÖ get-agent-plan-prices
**Status:** SECURE  
- Returns ONLY `retail_price` from `agent_pricing` table
- Does NOT expose wholesale prices
- Proper authorization checks in place

### ‚úÖ admin-agent-pricing  
**Status:** SECURE  
- Admin-only access (role check enforced)
- Service role bypassed for sensitive operations
- No wholesale data exposed to non-admins

---

## Database Access Patterns

### For Agents:
```sql
-- ‚úÖ ALLOWED (through views only)
SELECT * FROM agent_safe_plans WHERE is_active = true;
SELECT * FROM agent_safe_orders WHERE agent_id = '<their-agent-id>';

-- ‚ùå BLOCKED (RLS prevents direct access)
SELECT * FROM esim_plans;  -- Returns empty or error
SELECT wholesale_price FROM esim_plans;  -- No access
```

### For Admins:
```sql
-- ‚úÖ ALLOWED (full access)
SELECT * FROM esim_plans;
SELECT wholesale_price, supplier_name FROM esim_plans;
SELECT * FROM orders;
```

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Completed ‚úÖ):
1. ‚úÖ Secure views created with security_invoker
2. ‚úÖ RLS policies restricted to admin-only for sensitive tables
3. ‚úÖ All edge functions audited (no leaks found)

### Optional Enhancements:
1. **Enable Leaked Password Protection** (User Dashboard Setting):
   - Go to: Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Password Protection
   - Enable "Leaked Password Protection"
   - This is a Supabase Auth config, not a database migration

2. **Audit Logging** (Future):
   - Consider logging all access to wholesale data
   - Monitor for unusual query patterns

3. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - Quarterly review of RLS policies
   - Review edge function permissions
   - Check for new tables/views that might expose data

---

## Testing Recommendations

### To Verify Security:

1. **Test as Agent** (Non-admin user):
   ```javascript
   // Should FAIL or return empty
   const { data } = await supabase.from('esim_plans').select('wholesale_price');
   
   // Should SUCCEED with safe data only
   const { data } = await supabase.from('agent_safe_plans').select('*');
   ```

2. **Test as Admin**:
   ```javascript
   // Should SUCCEED with all data
   const { data } = await supabase.from('esim_plans').select('wholesale_price, supplier_name');
   ```

---

## Compliance & Data Protection

### Data Classification:
- **Highly Sensitive:** wholesale_price, supplier_name, supplier_plan_id
- **Protected:** Agent-specific pricing, profit margins
- **Public:** Plan titles, descriptions, validity periods

### Access Control Matrix:
| Data Type | Agents | Admins | Service Role |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------------|
| Wholesale Prices | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Supplier Info | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Retail Prices | ‚úÖ (own) | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Customer Data | ‚úÖ (own orders) | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

---

## Conclusion

Your wholesale prices and supplier information are NOW SECURE. Agents and external developers cannot access:
- Cost prices
- Supplier identities
- Supplier plan IDs
- Profit margins

All sensitive data is restricted to admin-only access through proper RLS policies and secure database views.
